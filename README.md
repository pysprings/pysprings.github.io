PySprings
=========
[Our meetup site](https://www.meetup.com/pysprings/) has the latest things that we do.

We meet at [the enclave](http://enclavecoop.com/) the second and fourth Tuesday of each month.

We also have a **Python For Absolute Beginners** class we do with the [Pikes Peak Library District](https://ppld.org/).

We also publish lots of projects and notes at <https://github.com/pysprings>.
