# Rectangle Platformer
We want to have a game wherein you are a rectangle that can jump on other
rectangles to get higher.

```
   +--+
   | Y|
   +--+  ------
---------
```

To do this, we're going to need four things:
* Physics engine to pull us down 
* A way to jump
* Keyboard input
* A way to tell what's going on


Arrow keys for up, right
1 fps minimum refresh rate
Rectangles of different colors
* It's going to be green
256px square screen
first platform will be at bottom of screen
next platform will be 10 px up from bottom
Need to be able to jump more than 10 px
Need to fall st you can make it up

Some way to quit (assume x up there / to let us out)
